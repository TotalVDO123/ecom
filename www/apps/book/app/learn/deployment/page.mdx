In this chapter, you’ll learn the general approach to deploying the Medusa application.

## Medusa Project Components

A standard Medusa project is made up of:

- Medusa application: The Medusa server and the Medusa Admin.
- One or more storefronts

![Diagram showcasing the connection between the three deployed components](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1708600807/Medusa%20Book/deployment-options_ceuuvo.jpg)

You can either deploy the Medusa application fully (server with the admin), or deploy the Medusa Admin separately. The storefront is always deployed separately.

---

## Deploying the Medusa Server

You must deploy the Medusa server before the admin or storefront, as both of them connect to it and won’t work without a deployed Medusa server URL.

![Diagram showcasing how the Medusa server and its associated services would be deployed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1708600972/Medusa%20Book/backend_deployment_pgexo3.jpg)

The `npm run build` command will compile your Medusa backend server and create a static bundle for the Admin dashboard. The output is written inside the `.medusa/server` directory, and you can deploy this directory without relying on the original TypeScript source.

Following are the hypothetical steps for creating and running the production build. The actual setup may vary depending upon your deployment host. However, the goal is to follow the following steps and run the production server from within the `.medusa/server` directory.

<Note title="Tip">

For optimal experience, make sure that the hosting provider and plan offer at least 2GB of RAM.

</Note>

```sh
# First create a build
npm run build

# Cd into the output directory.

cd .medusa/server

# Install production dependencies

npm ci --omit=dev

# Define environment variables before you attempt to start the server

# Run production server

npx medusa start
```

### Additional services

Your server connects to a PostgreSQL database, Redis, and other services relevant for your setup. Most hosting providers support deploying and managing these databases along with your Medusa server (such as Railway and DigitalOcean).

## Deploying the Medusa Admin

### Deploy Admin with the Server

The Medusa Admin can be deployed on the same hosting with the server.

In this scenario, make sure the hosting provider and plan of your choice provide at least 2GB of RAM, as the admin build requires high RAM usage.

![Diagram showcasing how the admin would be deployed along with the Medusa server.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1708601021/Medusa%20Book/admin_deployment_1_lyg4cp.jpg)

<Note title="Tip">

The server deployment guides mention details on how to deploy the admin with the Medusa server.

</Note>

### Deploy Admin Separately

You can deploy the admin into a separate hosting provider or instance. The admin can be hosted on providers that support front-end websites and frameworks, such as Vercel.

<Note title="Important">

Per Vercel’s [license and plans](https://vercel.com/pricing), their free plan can only be used for personal, non-commercial projects. So, you can deploy the Medusa Admin on the free plan for development purposes, but for commercial projects, you must update your Vercel plan.

</Note>

## Deploying the Storefront

The storefront is deployed separately from the Medusa application, and the hosting options depend on the tools and frameworks you use to create the storefront.

If you’re using the Next.js Starter storefront, you may deploy the storefront to any hosting provider that supports frontend frameworks, such as Vercel.

<Note title="Important">

Per Vercel’s [license and plans](https://vercel.com/pricing), their free plan can only be used for personal, non-commercial projects. So, you can deploy the storefront on the free plan for development purposes, but for commercial projects, you must update your Vercel plan.
